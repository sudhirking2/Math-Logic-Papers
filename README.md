# Math-Logic-Papers
Paper Submissions during my 2023 year UCR for Math/Logic.

(1) "Formal Semantics of Carnap" has been submitted to 
UTD’s Fourth Annual Undergraduate Philosophy Conference at March 9, 2023
I have written this paper writh the support of my Logic Professor, Dr. Micheal Nelson at UCR. 
It explores the formalistic point of view of how a model theory can look like of Carnap.io. 

(2) "Three Theorems on Interchanging Limits with Integrals in Calculus" will soon be submitted 
to UCR's Undergraduate Research Journal by April 7, 2023. 
It was the culmunation of an extra-credit project from my Analaysis Professor, Dr. Estela Gavosto. 
It explores A. J. Luxembourg’s proof of Dominated Convergence Theorem, suitable for undergraduate analysis. 

(3) "Strong Recursion Theorem and the Axiom of Strong Dependent Choice" will be submitted later 
to PUMP undergraduate math journal during Spring 2023, under the guidance of Professor Estela Gavosto. 
It will soon undergo strennous revision. It explores an alternative type-theoretic notation 
for Strong Recursion Theorem and Strong Dependent Choice using depedendnt produts $\Pi$. 
I am also working on formalizing this paper in Lean.
